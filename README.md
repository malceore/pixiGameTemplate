This is a very simple template that takes teh hassle out of starting a new simple javascript game project. Created for anyones use, I created it because I have a strong need to try out POCs for games and got tired of copying and guttint files from each successive game to the next.

Getting Started:  To start work simply open the index.html in any web browser, Chrome pref due to it's better webgl support as of this writing. 
Next let me familiarize you with the simple setup. All game starts with modifying the init.js file found in the bin directory. Inside this file you will find some simple Javascript functions that setup a PIXI.js canvas and start a forever running update loop. On body load the first function listed, init, is called, this creates a canvas, resizes it to fit the display and then starts the update loop. The best place to start would be to create a setup function somewhere between the resize and update functions. Inside update you can place all your sprites or text for your game. Pixi.js no includes a loader for JSON spritesheets that allows you to quickly add sprite sheet graphics to your game and may require you to load them before you setup, you can read more about this in the PIXI.js docs. After you get sprites to appear and have trouble shooted any problems you are then free to manipulate the code as you see fit.
